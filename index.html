        <h2>Keep your software and systems fully up to date : </h2>
        <p>Often cyber attacks happen because your systems or software aren’t fully up to date, leaving weaknesses. So
          cybercriminals exploit these weaknesses to gain access to your network. Once they are in – it’s often too late
          to take preventative action.</p>
        <p>Update the operating system on your mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. And update your applications –
          especially the web browsers – on all your devices too. Leverage automatic updates for all devices,
          applications, and operating systems.</p>

        <h2>Use strong and unique passwords for your accounts :</h2>
        <p>Did you know the most common password is “password”? Followed by “123456”? Using your child’s name with their
          birthday isn’t much better.</p>
        <p>Picking a password that is easy is like locking your door but hanging the key on the doorknob. Anyone can get
          in. </p>
        <p>Here are some tips for creating a stronger password. Make sure it’s: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>long – at least 15 characters.</li>
          <li>unique – never used anywhere else.</li>
          <li>randomly generated – usually by a computer or password manager. They’re better than humans at being
            random. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Make sure you’re not recycling the same password across all your apps and websites. You can use a password
          manager to store all of your passwords. That way you don’t have to remember them all! If you go this route,
          make sure your master password is strong and memorable.

        <h2>Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible :</h2>
        <p>It goes by many names: Two Factor Authentication. Multifactor Authentication. Two Step Factor Authentication.
          MFA. 2FA. They all mean the same thing: opting-into an extra step when trusted websites and applications ask
          you to confirm you’re really who you say you are.</p>
        <p>Your bank, your social media network, your school, your workplace…. they want to make sure you’re the one
          accessing your information.</p>
        <p>So, industry is taking a step to double check. Instead of asking you for a password – which can be reused,
          more easily cracked, or stolen.</p>

        <h2>Be cautious of phishing emails and messages :</h2>
        <p>This may sound a bit extreme – but always be on the lookout for deceitful emails and compromised web pages
          (spam and phishing). Interacting with these puts your information at risk and can download viruses. Remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>don't open email from unknown email addresses.</li>
          <li>trash attachments in unexpected emails.</li>
          <li>avoid risky clicks – instead type the address into your browser.</li>

        <h2>Regularly back up your important data :</h2>
        <p>Backing up collected data is an important part of data management. Backups protect against human error,
          hardware failure, virus attacks, power outages and natural disasters. When these errors occur, backups save
          time and money. </p>

        <h2>What is Data Backup? :</h2>
        <p>Data backup is making copies of scanned data and other business information in case the data becomes
          corrupted, deleted or lost. You can then use the backup copy to restore or recover your data for business
          continuity and disaster recovery.</p>
        <p>Many IT departments create multiple backup copies, keeping one copy on site for quick recovery and a second
          copy off-site, or in the cloud. This typically occurs in the event that the onsite copy is damaged due to a
          natural or man-made disaster.</p>
        <p>Early common methods of backing up data involved downloading data from the computer’s hard drive onto a set
          of small diskettes, which were stored in physical containers.</p>
        <p>Since then, the emergence of technology has made it possible to back up data remotely and download huge
          amounts of data to small portable devices. Cloud services and related options facilitate remote data storage,
          so that data is secure if an entire facility or site is compromised, while RAID, or mirroring technologies
          provide automated backup options.</p>

        <h2>Why is backing up computer data important? :</h2>
        <p>Cyber-attacks have become more common in recent years, so having a data backup and recovery solution is
          paramount. Even if your system is compromised or encrypted by ransomware, you can rest easy knowing that you
          have a clean copy of your data stored elsewhere. This allows you to repair the damage caused by ransomware
          attacks without giving in to blackmail from cybercriminals.</p>

        <h2>Secure Your Device :</h2>
        <p>If your device is unsecured, lost or stolen, it could be used to access your info, your money or steal your
          identity and irreplaceable data like photos or messages. Secure your devices by :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>installing anti-virus software.</li>
          <li>setting a password, gesture or fingerprint that must be entered to unlock.</li>
          <li>setting the device to require a password before applications are installed.</li>
          <li>leaving Bluetooth hidden when not in use and disabling automatic connection to networks.</li>
          <li>enabling remote locking and/or wiping functions, if your device supports them.</li>

        <h2>Avoid connecting to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks : </h2>
        <p>When accessing personal information checking your bank account information on the go, it’s important to avoid
          public Wi-Fi. Public Wi-Fi is much safer than it used to be, before the days of secure websites (the ones that
          begin with “https”). But there are still some security risks associated with public Wi-Fi, so using it
          (instead of your phone’s data plan, for instance), can leave you susceptible to malware. If you must access
          personal information through a laptop or cellphone on public Wi-Fi, it’s a good idea to use a VPN, or Virtual
          Public Network. This allows you to create your own secure connection to another network. For more about VPNs.

        <h2>What is cyber fraud? : </h2>
        <p>Cyber fraud is a blanket term to describe crimes committed by cyberattackers via the internet. These crimes
          are committed with the intent to illegally acquire and leverage an individual's or business’s sensitive
          information for monetary gain.</p>
        <div class="paper">
          <h3>Cyber fraud examples : </h3>
          <p>There are many different types of cyber fraud, but they all have one thing in common: the use of technology
            to commit a crime. Here are just a few examples of cyber fraud:</p>
          <div class="paper">
            <h4>Malware : </h4>
            <p>This is software that's designed to damage or disable computers. It can be used to steal personal
              information, delete files, or even create backdoors that allow cyber criminals to gain control of a
              victim's computer.</p>
            <div class="paper">
              <h4>Ransomware : </h4>
              <p>A type of malicious software cyber criminals use to encrypt a victim's files and demand payment in
                order
                to decrypt them. This type of attack is commonly carried out through malicious links or email
                attachments.
